## 👋 Who I Am

I'm **Vinitha Subash**, a passionate **Programmatic SEO (pSEO)** consultant and developer with over **15 years in web frameworks**—long before the term "programmatic SEO" became trendy.

I was part of the team behind **[babynames.com](https://babynames.com/)** back in **2011**, one of the earliest examples of structured, high-volume SEO content done right. What’s now called “programmatic SEO” has always been part of how I build.

For me, this isn’t just work—it’s **what I love doing**. I’m offering **free consultations** because I genuinely enjoy solving complex SEO challenges and helping businesses grow through smart automation and scalable architecture.

## 🧠 What Is Programmatic SEO?

Programmatic SEO is the art and science of publishing **millions of pages** based on structured data, templates, and automation tools—all designed to meet search intent at scale.

### Why It Works:
- 🚀 **Content Production at Scale**: Generate endless long-tail, keyword-rich pages using structured data from your business.
- 🔗 **Internal Linking at Scale**: Auto-generate internal link graphs that optimize **click depth**, improve crawl paths, and distribute authority across the entire site.
- 🧠 **SEO Optimization at Scale**: Schema markup, canonical tags, meta data, and indexation signals automatically deployed across massive datasets.
- ⚡ **Crawl Rate Optimization**: Clean HTML templates, optimized asset delivery, and serverless caching strategies bring crawl latency **below 100ms**.

Programmatic SEO (pSEO) allows you to generate thousands of search-optimized pages dynamically, using structured data and templates. With Django's flexibility and power, it becomes an ideal framework for executing scalable SEO strategies.
